Making an ai that can play the snake game using neat for practice(from scratch)
It works but when tried with more difficult games or when passing more information (like more pixels of the game) it slows down considewrable or it's learning process platue before it is efficent enough so it's only good for simple games and not for this project as I need to pass the whole screen of pixels.
